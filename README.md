# Krypt Blockchain

Krypt Blockchain

Krypt is a public blockchain designed for the tokenization and decentralized exchange of all types of assets and securities.

Vision
Krypt's vision is to facilitate the representation of real-world assets, such as real estate, commodities, services, among others, in the form of interchangeable tokens on our public blockchain, expanding investment and financing possibilities for millions of people.

Key Features
Native Cryptocurrency Krypt (KPT): Native medium of exchange within the Krypton network for executing transactions and paying fees.
Asset Tokenization: Real-world assets can be tokenized to create fungible tokens on the Krypton blockchain.
Decentralized Platform: Based on a blockchain network of nodes with a Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol.
Smart Contracts: Allows for the creation of rules and automation of processes through self-executable code on the blockchain.
Fast and Secure Transactions: Thanks to its PoS consensus and lightweight architecture.

Use Cases
Some examples of how Krypt could be applied:

A real estate agency tokenizes each of its properties to represent fractions of ownership and sell them globally.
An energy company generates tokens backed by its renewable energy production. Investors worldwide can exchange and trade these "Clean Energy Certificates."
An investment fund tokenizes its investment portfolio, allowing instant capital inflow and outflow.
The possibilities are immense. With Krypt, we tokenize the world!

Current Status
Krypt is an early-stage project that has a functioning MVP: Krypt currently has a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with the core functionalities of a blockchain:

Block Generation: It has a Block structure chained to form the blockchain, starting with the genesis block.
Proof of Stake Validation: Implements a PoS consensus protocol where validators are chosen based on their stake deposits.
Transactions: Allows for transfers of the native cryptocurrency Krypt between accounts through transactions that are verified and stored in blocks.
Accounts and Balances: Maintains a record of accounts and their available balances in both the native cryptocurrency and tokenized asset tokens.
Asset Tokenization: Features logic to tokenize real-world assets, generating tokens on the blockchain that represent fractional ownership of such assets.
P2P Interface: Enables decentralized node communication via a peer-to-peer protocol to propagate transactions and blocks.
API: Exposes a REST API to query the state of the blockchain and submit transaction or tokenization requests.
