# KryptBlockchain
Krypt Blockchain Proof Of Stake

Greetings,

I have developed a blockchain network from scratch using Python, specifically employing a proof of stake consensus mechanism. Presently, I am seeking a community on GitHub to collaborate with in refining and expanding upon this project to cultivate a novel vision.

The primary objective of this endeavor is to establish a blockchain infrastructure capable of tokenizing assets, particularly real estate holdings. These assets, referred to as "Kryptons," are stored and managed within the blockchain network, with the network's native cryptocurrency named "Krypt."

My aim is to enhance the existing codebase and foster a robust community around this project, recognizing that individual efforts may not suffice in identifying all potential shortcomings.

Beyond merely facilitating blockchain transactions and asset tokenization, the overarching vision entails the establishment of a marketplace within our network, enabling users to purchase these tokenized assets and assume ownership in the physical realm.

Central to this objective is the implementation of smart contracts to facilitate the seamless transfer of ownership following asset acquisition. Currently, the project's scope is centered on the utilization of Krypt and Kryptons exclusively.

Should you find this project intriguing and wish to contribute, please feel free to reach out to me via my personal email at brunoprida1@gmail.com.

Thank you for considering involvement in this initiative.
